    <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
    <p>You will need to create an individual file for each student who is on the radar. The idea is to generate weekly
        sheets that will be used for data collection. This spreadsheet will automatically create the weekly sheets for
        you and
        link each sheet's data to the <em>Summary</em> sheet.<br><br>Below are the steps for the initial setup of a
        student's
        <i>Radar Data Collection Spreadsheet</i>.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Use this downloaded spreadsheet as a template for each of your students on the radar. Do this by making a
            copy of
            the spreadsheet in your Google Drive and placing it in a folder where you can easily access it (for example,
            as a
            hyperlink on your Portal or a bookmark in your Chrome browser).</li>
        <li>Within the spreadsheet, locate the sheet named <i>Week_Template</i> and enter the student‚Äôs classes in the
            yellow-colored cells (O2 through X2). The template allows space for up to 10 classes. If you do not need all
            10,
            simply use the first few cells and leave the remaining ones blank. The class information will automatically
            transfer
            to the cells in column A of the <i>Week_Template</i>.</li>
        <li>Create the weekly data collection sheets by either (1) closing this text box, clicking on <i>üìà Data
                Collection
                Information üìâ</i>, then selecting <i>Create Weekly Sheets</i>; or (2) clicking on <a href="#"
                class="link-style" onclick="setupWeeklyBehaviorSheets(); return false;">this hyperlink</a> and giving
            the browser a few seconds to
            start the script.</li>
        <li>When prompted, enter the date you want to begin data collection, then the number of weekly sheets you would
            like
            to create.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Give the script a few seconds to generate the weekly sheets and link them to the <i>Summary</i> sheet. Each
        weekly
        sheet includes a column for each weekday, so the dates will begin on the Monday prior to the start date you
        entered.<br><br>Once the script finishes running, you will see the weekly sheets listed across the bottom of the
        spreadsheet. You are now ready to input data into the <i>Occurrences</i> and <i>Rating</i> cells. The data will
        automatically update in both the weekly sheets and the summary sheet.</p>

        function setupWeeklyBehaviorSheets() {
            // This function will be called when the link is clicked
            google.script.run
                // .withSuccessHandler(() => alert('Weekly sheets created successfully!'))
                .withFailureHandler(error => alert('Error: ' + error.message))
                .setupWeeklyBehaviorSheets();
        }
